export default 'By default, how the flow is launched determines whether the flow runs in the context of the user or the system. If you choose system context with sharing, the flow respects org-wide default settings, role hierarchies, sharing rules, manual sharing, teams, and territories. But it doesnâ€™t respect object permissions, field-level access, or other permissions of the running user. If you choose system context without sharing, the flow can access all data.';
