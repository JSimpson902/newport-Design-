export default 'Enter the number of records that this path can process at the same time. The default is 200, which is the maximum, and the minimum is 1. For example, if you specify a batch size of two and seven records are scheduled to be processed in the same time interval, Flow Builder groups them into four batches. Set a batch size smaller than 200 to improve performance and to avoid hitting Apex governor limits.';
