export default 'Add a scheduled path if you want part of or the entire flow to run some time after the triggering record is {0}. That scheduled time can be based on when the record is {0}, or based on a field value in the record. A separate flow interview runs for each scheduled path. Path labels appear on connectors in the canvas. Consider using path labels such as "Run 1 Day After Case Is Created" and "Run When Case Is Closed".';
