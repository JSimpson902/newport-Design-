export default 'Enter a number from 1 to 2,000 to prioritize the order that the flow triggers run for a specified object. The trigger order value determines the order that flows with the same trigger type (before- or after-save) run for the same object. For example, you can prioritize an after-save flow to run before other after-save flows on the Case object. But you canâ€™t prioritize an after-save flow to run before any before-save flows or before an Apex trigger.';
