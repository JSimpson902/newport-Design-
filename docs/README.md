[![lerna](https://img.shields.io/badge/maintained%20with-lerna-cc00ff.svg)](https://lerna.js.org/)

Flow Builder is a project that provides an builder app to create flows, and a set of reusable lwc components.

## Getting started

Instructions to setup your environment to develop and run the Flow Builder app in core can be found [here](/docs/DevelopmentSetup.md)

Take a look at the [Setup FAQ](https://salesforce.quip.com/BFVUA1AxQWKb) if you run into any issues or the [#move-builder-to-git](https://platformcloud.slack.com/archives/CQH866GSZ) slack channel.

## Overview of the structure of the repo

The repo defines multiple npm packages in the `packages` folder. The package `flow-builder/ui` is the npm package for the `ui-interaction-builder-components`. This is where you will find all the code that has been migrated from P4.

It is build and managed using `yarn`.

## Running the tests

You can run all the tests by doing `yarn test:unit`

If you want to run/debug a single test you should cd to the packages where the test is located and use `yarn lwc-test` eg

`cd packages/@flow-builder/ui`
`yarn lwc-test src/builder_platform_interaction/editor/__tests__/editor.test.ts`

To debug a test:
`yarn lwc-test --debug src/builder_platform_interaction/editor/__tests__/editor.test.ts`

To update all the snaphots in a package:
`yarn lwc-test --updateSnapshot`

## SFCI Setup and CLCO

To add a new branch under SFCI you need to do the following:

-   Edit the `git-perforce-branch-mapping.yaml` and `sfci.yaml`
-   In the repo's github Settings, make the new branch protected
-   Run a SFCI seed job like here https://sfcirelease.dop.sfdc.net/job/SFCI%20MIGRATION%20JOBS/job/SFCI%20seed%20job/

```text
git_organization_name: automation-platform
git_repository_name: ui-interaction-builder-components
git_branches: master,226,226-freeze
existing_Jenkins_URL: https://automation-builderci.dop.sfdc.ne
jenkinsfile_path: Jenkinsfile
```

-   Reach out to the SFCI team (`#sfci-support` on slack) and ask them to point the managed pipeline file to that seed job. (This is needed because we are using a managed pipeline, and we don't have a Jenkins file)
