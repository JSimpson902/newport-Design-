# IDE Setup

You can use any IDE you want to run Builder Framework, but the following IDEs are ones that Builder Framework devs use and you
will have the most success in finding additional support and tools:

-   [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) **_Recommended local development_**
    -   Debug configuration already setup
    -   Commit Signing through GUI
    -   Check out [LWC-VSCode](https://git.soma.salesforce.com/lwc/lwc-vscode) for LWC tooling
-   [Intellij](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) **Recommended for development with Core**
    -   Intellij is great for working along side Core as it has modern tooling and
        internal support to handle running Core
    -   See the [Gus group](https://gus.lightning.force.com/lightning/r/CollaborationGroup/0F9B000000000GnKAI/view) for details
-   Eclipse
    -   If you are running Eclipse, I only recommend it for Core. You will need to follow this additional [documentation](Eclipse.md) for setup
-   Vim/Command Line
