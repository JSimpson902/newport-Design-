# Best Practices

## UX

Out of the box, Builder Framework provides Platform approved UX solutions to builders.
If you are developing your own solutions [reach out](/docs/CONTACT_US.md) to us and we can put you in contact with our UX engineer.

## Accessibility

Builder Framework default UI implementations also provide accessible solutions to all user interactions.

If you are looking to change those or remove them for your own implementations, please reach out to your accessibility engineer or
[to us](/docs/CONTACT_US.md) if you have any questions.

I highly recommend you checkout the [Accessibility Checklist](https://sites.google.com/salesforce.com/accessibility/checklists)
